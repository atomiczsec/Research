### How is this malware delivered?

It all starts from a DM from user *Damianeq93#3538*

Once you join in the server you will see advertisements for free cheat ware these ads come link 2 websites where these cheats are hosted:

Now lets take a look at downloading one of these files . All files are hosted on discord which is a weird spot to host files. 
Taking a look at one of these cheats we get a lot of hits on Virus Total
Take a look at this graph to see how many detection are linked with this zip

From the File hosted on discord labeled as "Infinity Cheats Loader.zip" we have 2 main files 
"InfinityCheatsLoader.exe" and "LithiumCore.dll"

Infinity Cheats Loader has contacted 2 domains 

 1. cdn.discordapp.com (where the file was hosted)
 2. t4ck0wsvvpbmktxzluyee11uce27kbct.nl (Some files hosted + additional malware)

Infinity Cheats Loader also drops a malicious file

 1. "node.exe" (c7763a056e28d06eeca1405377a3f2c1b291b02c38725aa3d411b814100330d2)
 
After some additional research this is either BBY stealer or something similar. BBY stealer is a piece of malware that steals things such as chrome login data. We see this behavior when it tries to grab:
"%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data.bby"

It also creates and runs some powershell scripts:
"C:\Users\user\Desktop\temp.ps1"

The rest of this behavior can be looked at with the hashes a have provided. 
Here is a list of some IOCs (Indicator of Compromise) :
